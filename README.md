## About Project

This project is a web-based Todo list application that allows users to organize their tasks using various features. Users can create an account to access the application, and if they don't have one, they can register before using the app.

Key features of the application include:

1. Grouping Tasks: Users can categorize their tasks into different groups or sections, making it easier to manage and prioritize them efficiently.

2. Add Task: Users can create new tasks by providing task descriptions and optionally setting due dates or adding other relevant details.

3. Edit Task: Users have the flexibility to modify existing tasks, including updating task descriptions, changing due dates, or making any necessary adjustments.

4. Move Task: Users can move tasks between different groups or reorder them based on their preferences, helping them maintain better task organization.

5. Delete Task: Users can remove tasks from the list when they are completed or no longer needed.

The application aims to enhance productivity and task management by providing a user-friendly interface that streamlines the process of planning, tracking, and organizing tasks effectively.

Please note that since this is just a description, the actual implementation and user interface design may require further elaboration and development based on specific requirements and design choices.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

installing all of the packages that used in this project

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## .env file

First, you need to create a .env file at the same level as the src folder. Inside the .env file, you should have the following values:

```
REACT_APP_BASEURL=https://todo-api-18-140-52-65.rakamin.com
```
